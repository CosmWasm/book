# Actor model

This section describes the fundamentals of the architecture of CosmWasm smart contracts, which determines how they communicate
with each other. It is useful to go through this to get an idea of what to expect, before go through in detail how to create multiple contracts that relate to each other. Don't worry if it's not totally clear after the first read.  We suggest going
through this chapter once now and maybe giving it another review once you are familiar with the  practical part.

The whole thing described here is officially documented in the
[SEMANTICS.md](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/SEMANTICS.md), of the `cosmwasm` repository.
