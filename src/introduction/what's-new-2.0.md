We invite you to review the [official changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed account of all changes, enhancements, and fixes introduced in CosmWasm 2.0. This document offers a thorough overview of the development priorities and the significant updates made in this release.


## Highlights from the changelog include:

- **IBC Integration**: Added `IbcMsg::Transfer` with an optional memo field for improved cross-chain interactions. Introduced IbcReceiveResponse::without_ack constructor to simplify IBC packet handling by making acknowledgements optional. (References: [#1878], [#1892])
- **Performance Optimizations**: Addressed memory increase issues and optimized Wasmer Engine usage to enhance contract execution efficiency. Updated to Wasmer 4.2.5 and adjusted memory handling and function parameter limits for better performance, resulting in faster execution and reduced gas costs. (References: [#1978], [#1992], [#2005], [#1991])
- **Security Enhancements**: Fixes addressing specific vulnerabilities, such as CWA-2023-004, directly contribute to the security robustness of CosmWasm contracts. The removal of features that potentially impact security, coupled with the continuous update and refinement of the contract environment, ensures a safer execution space for smart contracts. ([#1996])
- **Developer Tooling** : The update focused on streamlining error handling and backtraces within smart contracts. The backtraces feature has been removed from cosmwasm-std, and developers can now utilize the RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable for error diagnostics. This change ensures that error variants consistently contain backtrace information, simplifying debugging processes for developers. ([#1967])

These updates are part of our ongoing commitment to providing a powerful, flexible, and secure smart contract platform that meets the evolving needs of the blockchain developer community.
