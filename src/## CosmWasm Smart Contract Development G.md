 ## CosmWasm Smart Contract Development Guide

### Prerequisites

To work with CosmWasm smart contracts, you'll need the following prerequisites:

1. **Rust**: Follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust. Make sure you're using a stable Rust channel.

2. **Wasm Rust Compiler Backend**: Install the Wasm Rust compiler backend to build Wasm binaries:

   ```
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. **Optional: wasmd Binary**: If you want to try out your contracts on a testnet, you'll need the `wasmd` binary. Install Go and then clone and install `wasmd`:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:CosmWasm/wasmd.git
   cd ./wasmd
   make install
   ```

4. **Docker**: You'll need Docker to upload Rust Wasm Contracts into the blockchain.

5. **cosmwasm-check Utility**: This utility helps you check if your Wasm binary is a proper smart contract ready for upload. Install it using Cargo:

   ```
   cargo install cosmwasm-check
   ```

### Verifying the Installation

To ensure you're ready to build smart contracts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the [cw-plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) repository:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:CosmWasm/cw-plus.git
   ```

2. Run the testing command in the `cw-plus` folder:

   ```
   cd ./cw-plus
   cargo test
   ```

   You should see that everything in the repository gets compiled, and all tests pass.

### Building a Smart Contract

Let's build a smart contract as an example.

1. Go to a contract directory, for example, `contracts/cw1-whitelist`.

2. Build the smart contract using Cargo:

   ```
   cargo wasm
   ```

   The output binary will be in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` directory of the root repo directory.

### Validating the Smart Contract

Use the `cosmwasm-check` utility to validate the smart contract:

```
cosmwasm-check ../../
