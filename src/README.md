# Introduction

This book is a guide for creating CosmWasm smart contracts. It will lead you
step by step through the process, and explain all of the relevant topics from
the easiest to the trickiest ones.

The idea of the book is not only to describe the API for smart contracts but also
to show you how to use them in a clean and maintainable way. We will show you
patterns that CosmWasm creators have established and encourage you to use as well.

## Prerequirements

This book explores CosmWasm smart contracts. It is not a Rust tutorial, and
assumes basic Rust knowledge.  We strongly recommend ensuring you have a good
grasp of the language itself first. You can find great resources for starting
with Rust on [Learn Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) page.
