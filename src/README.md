# Introduction

This book is a guide for creating CosmWasm smart contracts. It would lead you step by step,
and explain relevant topics from the easiest to the more tricky ones.

The idea of the book is not only to tell you about smart contracts API but also want to show
you how to do it in a clean and maintainable way. We will show you patterns that CosmWasm
creators established and encouraged you to use.

This is the guide-like documentation. If you are looking for the API documentation, you may
