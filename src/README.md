# [Introduction](https://book.cosmwasm.com/#introduction)

This book is a guide for creating CosmWasm smart contracts. It will lead you step by step and explain relevant topics from easiest to trickier.

The idea of the book is not only to tell you about smart contracts API but also to show you how to make it clean and maintainable. We will show you patterns that CosmWasm creators established and encouraged you to use.
