# Introduction

This book is a guide for creating CosmWasm smart contracts. It will lead you
step by step, and explain relevant topics from the easiest to the trickier
ones.

The idea of the book is not only to tell you about smart contracts API but also
to show you how to do it in a clean and maintainable way. We will show you
patterns that CosmWasm creators established and encouraged you to use.

## Prerequirements

This book explores CosmWasm smart contracts. It is not a Rust tutorial, and it
assumes basic Rust knowledge. As you will probably learn it alongside this
book, I strongly recommend grasping the language itself first. You can find
great resources to start with Rust on [Learn
Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) page.

## CosmWasm API documentation

This is the guide-like documentation. If you are looking for the API
documentation, you may be interested in checking one of the following:
