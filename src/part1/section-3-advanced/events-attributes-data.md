In the evolving landscape of CosmWasm 2.0, the mechanisms for smart contracts to communicate with the external world have been refined and expanded. This includes the use of events for logging activities and data for structured information exchange between contracts. Here, we delve into how to leverage these tools in the CosmWasm 2.0 framework, particularly focusing on the addition of administrators as a practical example of event usage.

# Events: Broadcasting Activities
Events are integral to smart contracts in CosmWasm 2.0, providing a way for contracts to emit information about activities or changes that occur during their execution. This is particularly useful for tracking actions, such as the addition of new administrators, through the blockchain's event logs.

# Example: Emitting an admin_added Event
Consider a scenario where your contract emits an admin_added event upon successfully adding a new administrator through the AddMembers function:
```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{
    to_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, Event, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult,
};

pub fn add_members(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    admins: Vec<String>,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let mut curr_admins = ADMINS.load(deps.storage)?;
    if !curr_admins.contains(&info.sender) {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized { sender: info.sender });
    }

    let events = admins.iter().map(|admin| Event::new("admin_added").add_attribute("addr", admin));
    let resp = Response::new()
        .add_events(events)
        .add_attribute("action", "add_members")
        .add_attribute("added_count", admins.len().to_string());

    let admins: StdResult<Vec<_>> = admins.into_iter().map(|addr| deps.api.addr_validate(&addr)).collect();
    curr_admins.append(&mut admins?);
    ADMINS.save(deps.storage, &curr_admins)?;

    Ok(resp)
}
```
In this implementation, an event for each added admin is created and appended to the contract's response. This approach not only logs the addition of new administrators but also provides detailed information about the action, including the number of admins added.

## Testing Event Emissions

Testing for event emissions can sometimes introduce complexity due to the reliance on string-based keys and values. However, it's essential for ensuring that your contract behaves as expected. Here's how you might test the add_members function to verify that events are emitted correctly:

```rust

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use cosmwasm_std::testing::{mock_dependencies, mock_env, mock_info};
    use cosmwasm_std::{from_binary, Addr, StdResult};

    #[test]
    fn add_members_emits_events() {
        let mut deps = mock_dependencies();
        let info = mock_info("owner", &[]);
        let add_members_msg = ExecuteMsg::AddMembers { admins: vec!["user".to_owned()] };

        let response = add_members(deps.as_mut(), info, add_members_msg).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(response.events.len(), 1); // Check for one "admin_added" event

        let admin_added_event = &response.events[0];
        assert_eq!(admin_added_event.ty, "admin_added");
        assert_eq!(admin_added_event.attributes[0], ("addr", "user"));
    }
}
```
This test ensures that the add_members function emits the admin_added event with the correct attributes.

## Data: Structured Contract-to-Contract Communication
While events offer a way to log activities, CosmWasm 2.0 also provides a mechanism for contracts to communicate structured data through responses. This is particularly useful for contract-to-contract interactions where a contract execution needs to return more complex information.

Data is set in a contract's response using the set_data function and can include any binary-encoded information, allowing for flexible and efficient data exchange between contracts.

## Integrating Events and Data into Your Contract
Understanding and implementing events and data in CosmWasm 2.0 are crucial for building advanced and interactive smart contracts. While events provide transparency and traceability for contract activities, data enables rich, structured communication between contracts, opening up a wide array of possibilities for decentralized application development.

Incorporating these concepts into your CosmWasm 2.0 contracts not only enhances their functionality but also aligns with best practices for smart contract development in the Cosmos ecosystem.
