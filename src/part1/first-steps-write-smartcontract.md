# 3. First Steps: Writing a Simple Contract

## Building Your First Contract

### Tutorial on Basic Contract Structure

CosmWasm smart contracts are written in Rust and follow a specific structure. Key components include:

- **Instantiate Function**: Initializes the contract state.
- **Execute Function**: Contains the logic that alters the contract state.
- **Query Function**: Used for reading contract state without making changes.

```rust
// Example of a simple CosmWasm contract structure
use cosmwasm_std::{entry_point, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};

#[entry_point]
pub fn instantiate(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo, msg: InstantiateMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // Instantiate logic here
}

#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo, msg: ExecuteMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // Execute logic here
}

#[entry_point]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    // Query logic here
}
```
## Tips for Writing Clean and Efficient Code

Follow Rust Best Practices: Utilize Rust's features like ownership, types, and error handling to write safe and efficient code.

- Keep it Simple: Start with a simple logic and gradually add complexity.
- Testing: Regularly test your code to catch and fix errors early.

## Deploying and Testing the Contract

### Compilation and Deployment
Compile your contract to WebAssembly (WASM) and deploy it either locally or on a testnet.

# Compile the contract to 
```
cargo wasm

# Deploy using CosmWasm tooling (specific commands vary based on the deployment target)
```
# Introduction to Testing Frameworks

CosmWasm provides testing frameworks that allow you to write unit tests for your contracts.
```rust
// Example of a simple unit test in CosmWasm
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // Unit tests here
}
```
# Multi-test examples
