# 5. Smart Contract Development

## Writing Contracts Like a Pro

As we move beyond the basics, this section is dedicated to best practices in smart contract development within the CosmWasm ecosystem. The goal is to ensure that contracts are not only functional but also efficient, secure, and easy to maintain.

## Best Practices in Contract Development

### Code Organization

Good code organization is key to maintaining and scaling smart contracts. Here are some tips:

- **Modular Design**: Break your contract into smaller, reusable modules.
- **Clear Documentation**: Comment your code and maintain updated documentation.
- **Version Control**: Use version control systems like Git to manage changes and collaborate.

### Security Practices

Security is paramount in smart contract development. Pay attention to:

- **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs to prevent injections and other attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to avoid unexpected failures.
- **Audits and Reviews**: Regularly audit your code and participate in peer reviews.

## Advanced Contract Functionalities

In CosmWasm, smart contracts can be equipped with advanced functionalities:

- **Complex State Management**: Strategies for handling sophisticated state mechanisms within contracts.
- **External Data Integration**: Techniques for integrating external data sources safely and efficiently.
- **Optimizing Contract Logic**: Best practices for optimizing contract execution and resource usage.

### Example: Advanced State Management

```rust
// Example Rust code demonstrating advanced state management in CosmWasm

#[cw_serde]
struct Person {
    pub name: String,
    pub last_name: String,
    pub age: u32,
}

#[index_list(Person)]
struct PersonIndexes<'a> {
    pub name_lastname: UniqueIndex<'a, (Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>), Person, String>,
}

/// This stores our person data. We want to be able to access it by the key we save it with,
/// but also by the combination of name and last_name, so we use an IndexedMap
const PERSON: IndexedMap<&str, Person, PersonIndexes> = IndexedMap::new(
    "data",
    PersonIndexes {
        name_lastname: UniqueIndex::new(
            |d| (d.name.as_bytes().to_vec(), d.last_name.as_bytes().to_vec()),
            "data__name_lastname",
        ),
    },
);

// save some people
let maria_williams = Person {
    name: "Maria".to_string(),
    last_name: "Williams".to_string(),
    age: 32,
};
PERSON.save(&mut store, "1", &maria_williams).unwrap();
let maria_park = Person {
    name: "Maria".to_string(),
    last_name: "Park".to_string(),
    age: 28,
};
PERSON.save(&mut store, "2", &maria_park).unwrap();

// we can load from the key we used to save
let person = PERSON.load(&store, "1").unwrap();
assert_eq!(person, maria_williams);

// but also from the index using the full name
let (key, d) = PERSON
    .idx
    .name_lastname
    .item(
        &store,
        ("Maria".as_bytes().to_vec(), "Williams".as_bytes().to_vec()),
    )
    .unwrap()
    .unwrap();
assert_eq!(key, b"1");
assert_eq!(d, maria_williams);
```
