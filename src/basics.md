# Basics

In this chapter, we will go through creating essential smart contracts step by step. I will explain the core ideas behind CosmWasm and the typical contract structure.

### **Introduction to CosmWasm**

**How to Understand Core Concepts:**

- **Wasm**: Experiment with compiling simple Rust programs to WebAssembly to understand the compilation process. Tools like **`wasm-pack`** can help in this learning phase.
- **Interoperability**: Explore the Cosmos SDK documentation and IBC protocol to grasp how CosmWasm facilitates cross-chain interactions. Look for simple IBC examples or tutorials to see this in action.
- **Rust Programming Language**: If new to Rust, start with "The Rust Programming Language" book (often referred to as "The Book") available for free online. Rust's ownership model and safety guarantees are crucial for writing secure smart contracts.

### **Typical Contract Structure**

1. **Contract Entry Points**
    
    **How to Implement Entry Points:**
    
    - **Instantiate**: Begin by defining what initial state your contract will have. Implement the **`instantiate`** function to set initial values, ensuring to handle any necessary input validation.
    - **Execute**: Identify the actions your contract must support. Implement each action as a case within the **`execute`** function, manipulating the contract's state as required.
    - **Query**: Determine the data users might need to read from your contract. Implement the **`query`** function to return this data, ensuring no state modification occurs.
2. **Messages**
    
    **How to Define Messages:**
    
    - Use Rust's **`enum`** and **`struct`** to define messages. Each action your contract supports will be a variant in the **`ExecuteMsg`** enum. Similarly, define **`InstantiateMsg`** and **`QueryMsg`** based on what data they must carry.
3. **State Management**
    
    **How to Manage State:**
    
    - Design your state model carefully, considering how data is accessed and updated. Use the **`DepsMut`** for state mutations and **`Deps`** for state queries. Implement helper functions for common state operations to encapsulate the storage access patterns.
4. **Dependencies**
    
    **How to Handle Dependencies:**
    
    - Familiarize yourself with the **`cosmwasm_std`** library's API by reading the documentation and looking at example contracts. For external crates, ensure they support compilation to **`wasm32-unknown-unknown`** target.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Smart Contract**

1. **Setup**
    - Install Rust and **`cargo`** using rustup. Set up your IDE for Rust development (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc.). Create a new project using **`cargo new --lib your_contract_name`**.
2. **Define Messages**
    - Sketch out the functionality of your contract. For each function, define a message in Rust, using structs for data and enums for differentiating message types.
3. **Implement Entry Points**
    - Start with the **`instantiate`** function for setting the initial state. Proceed to **`execute`** where you'll handle different messages as per your contract's logic. Finally, implement **`query`** for data retrieval.
4. **State Management**
    - Use the **`cosmwasm_std::Storage`** trait for state management. Design your key-value schema and implement getter and setter functions for interacting with the state.
5. **Business Logic**
    - Flesh out the business logic within the **`execute`** function. Consider edge cases and input validation to ensure contract security and reliability.
6. **Testing**
    - Write unit tests for each entry point and critical functions within your contract. Use **`cargo test`** to run your tests. Consider edge cases and invalid inputs to ensure your contract behaves as expected under various conditions.

### Error Handling

**How to Handle Errors:**

- Implement robust error handling using Rust's **`Result`** and **`Option`** types. Utilize custom error types defined with **`thiserror`** to provide clear, actionable error messages.
- Use **`?`** for error propagation within your contract functions to keep your code clean and readable.

### Migration Function

**How to Implement Migration:**

- The **`migrate`** function allows contract upgrades. Define it similarly to **`instantiate`** and **`execute`**, but focus on transitioning from one contract state version to another safely.
- Ensure data integrity and compatibility between versions. Test migrations thoroughly in a controlled environment before deploying.

### External Crates Usage

**Examples of Compatible Crates:**

- **`serde_json`** for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- **`cw-storage-plus`** for advanced storage patterns.
- Always check the crate's documentation for **`no_std`** compatibility or specific instructions for Wasm targets.

### Interaction Patterns

**Cross-Contract Calls:**

- Use the **`CosmosMsg::Wasm(WasmMsg::Execute { ... })`** pattern to call other contracts. Handle responses using the **`SubMsg`** pattern for asynchronous execution.
- Consider the implications of external calls failing and implement fallback or retry logic as needed.

### Security Practices

**Smart Contract Security:**

- Avoid common pitfalls like reentrancy by carefully managing state changes and external calls.
- Utilize Rust's strong type system to prevent issues like overflow/underflow.
- Regularly audit your contracts and consider third-party reviews for critical applications.

### Optimization Tips

**Gas Efficiency:**

- Minimize storage access, as it's typically the most expensive operation. Cache results when possible.
- Use iterators wisely. Avoid loading entire datasets into memory when a filter or map operation can be applied directly.

### Deployment and Testing on a Blockchain

**Blockchain Testing and Deployment:**

- Use **`wasmd`** for local testing and deployment simulations. Familiarize yourself with **`wasmd`** CLI commands for deploying and interacting with your contracts.
- Test your contract on a public testnet to ensure it behaves as expected in a real blockchain environment.

### Tooling and IDE Setup

**Recommended Development Tools:**

- Visual Studio Code with the Rust Analyzer extension for Rust development.
- Use **`cargo-contract`** for contract compilation and artifact generation.
- Integrate debugging tools like **`console_error_panic_hook`** for better error visibility in Wasm.

### Community Resources and Support

**Engaging with the Community:**

- Join the CosmWasm GitHub discussions and Discord server for support and to connect with other developers.
- Stay updated with the latest CosmWasm releases and best practices by following the official CosmWasm documentation and blog.

By addressing these areas, developers are equipped with a deeper understanding and practical tools to navigate the complexities of smart contract development in CosmWasm. This expanded guide aims to foster the creation of secure, efficient, and maintainable smart contracts within the Cosmos ecosystem.
