# Quick start with `wasmd`

In the past, we suggested playing with contracts on the `malaga` testnet using `wasmd`.
Now `malaga` is no longer operative, and the best way to test the contract in the
real environment is to use one of the big CosmWasm chains testnets - Osmosis, Juno,
Terra, or other ones.
[Here](https://docs.osmosis.zone/cosmwasm/testnet/cosmwasm-deployment/) is the
recommended introduction on how to start with the Osmosis testnet.
