# Quick start with `wasmd`

We used to suggest playing with contracts on the `malaga` testnet using `wasmd`.
Since `malaga` is no longer operational, currently the best way to test the contract in a
real environment is to use one of the big CosmWasm chains testnets: Osmosis, Juno,
Terra, etc.
[Here](https://docs.osmosis.zone/cosmwasm/testnet/cosmwasm-deployment/) is the
introduction we recommend which explains how to start with the Osmosis testnet.
