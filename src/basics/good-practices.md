# Good practices

All the relevant basics are covered. Now let's talk about some good practices.

## JSON renaming

Due to Rust style, all our message variants are spelled in a
[camel-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase). It is standard practice,
but it has a drawback - all messages are serialized and deserialized by serde
using those variant names. The problem is that it is more common to use [snake
cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) for field names in the JSON
world. Hopefully, there is an effortless way to tell serde, to change the names
casing for serialization purposes. Let's update our messages with a `#[serde]`
attribute:

```rust,noplayground
use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub admins: Vec<String>,
    pub donation_denom: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    AddMembers { admins: Vec<String> },
    Leave {},
    Donate {},
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct GreetResp {
    pub message: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct AdminsListResp {
    pub admins: Vec<Addr>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    Greet {},
    AdminsList {},
}
```

## JSON schema

Talking about JSON API, it is worth mentioning JSON Schema. It is a way of defining a shape for JSON messages.
It is good practice to provide a way to generate schemas for contract API. The problem is that writing JSON
schemas by hand is a pain. The good news is that there is a crate that would help us with that. Go to the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "contract"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = { version = "1.1.4", features = ["staking"] }
serde = { version = "1.0.103", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
cw-storage-plus = "0.15.1"
thiserror = "1"
schemars = "0.8.1"
cosmwasm-schema = "1.1.4"

[dev-dependencies]
cw-multi-test = "0.13.4"
```

There is one additional change in this file - in `crate-type` I added "rlib". "cdylib" crates cannot be used as typical
Rust dependencies. As a consequence, it is impossible to create examples for such crates.

Now go back to `src/msg.rs` and add a new derive for all messages:

```rust,noplayground
# use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use schemars::JsonSchema;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub admins: Vec<String>,
    pub donation_denom: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    AddMembers { admins: Vec<String> },
    Leave {},
    Donate {},
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct GreetResp {
    pub message: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct AdminsListResp {
    pub admins: Vec<Addr>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug, Clone, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    Greet {},
    AdminsList {},
}
```

You may argue that all those derives look slightly clunky, and I agree.
Hopefully, the
[`cosmwasm-schema`](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-schema/1.1.4/cosmwasm_schema/#)
crate delivers a utility `cw_serde` macro, which we can use to reduce a
boilerplate:

```rust,noplayground
# use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde

#[cw_serde]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub admins: Vec<String>,
    pub donation_denom: String,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    AddMembers { admins: Vec<String> },
    Leave {},
    Donate {},
}

#[cw_serde]
pub struct GreetResp {
    pub message: String,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub struct AdminsListResp {
    pub admins: Vec<Addr>,
}

#[cw_serde]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    Greet {},
    AdminsList {},
}
```

Additionally, we have to derive the additional `QueryResponses` trait for our
query message to correlate the message variants with responses we would
generate for them:

```rust,noplayground
# use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use cosmwasm_schema::{cw_serde, QueryResponses}

# #[cw_serde]
# pub struct InstantiateMsg {
#     pub admins: Vec<String>,
#     pub donation_denom: String,
# }
# 
# #[cw_serde]
# pub enum ExecuteMsg {
#     AddMembers { admins: Vec<String> },
#     Leave {},
#     Donate {},
# }
# 
# #[cw_serde]
# pub struct GreetResp {
#     pub message: String,
# }
# 
# #[cw_serde]
# pub struct AdminsListResp {
#     pub admins: Vec<Addr>,
# }
# 
#[cw_serde]
#[derive(QueryResponses)]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    #[returns(GreetResp)]
    Greet {},
    #[returns(AdminsListResp)]
    AdminsList {},
}
```

The `QueryResponses` is a trait that requires the `#[returns(...)]` attribute
to all your query variants to generate additional information about the
query-response relationship.

Now, we want to make the `msg` module public and accessible by crates depending
on our contract (in this case - for schema example). Update a `src/lib.rs`:

```rust,noplayground
# use cosmwasm_std::{entry_point, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};
# use error::ContractError;
# use msg::{ExecuteMsg, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
# 
pub mod contract;
pub mod error;
pub mod msg;
pub mod state;
# 
# #[entry_point]
# pub fn instantiate(
#     deps: DepsMut,
#     env: Env,
#     info: MessageInfo,
#     msg: InstantiateMsg,
# ) -> StdResult<Response> {
#     contract::instantiate(deps, env, info, msg)
# }
# 
# #[entry_point]
# pub fn execute(
#     deps: DepsMut,
#     env: Env,
#     info: MessageInfo,
#     msg: ExecuteMsg,
# ) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
#     contract::execute(deps, env, info, msg)
# }
# 
# #[entry_point]
# pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
#     contract::query(deps, env, msg)
# }
```

I changed the visibility of all modules - as our crate can now be used as a dependency.
If someone would like to do so, he may need access to handlers or state. 

The next step is to create a tool generating actual schemas. We will do it by creating
an binary in our crate. Create a new `bin/schema.rs` file:

```rust,noplayground
use contract::msg::{ExecuteMsg, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
use cosmwasm_schema::write_api;

fn main() {
    write_api! {
        instantiate: InstantiateMsg,
        execute: ExecuteMsg,
        query: QueryMsg
    }
}
```

Cargo is smart enough to recognize files in `src/bin` directory as utility
binaries for the crate. Now we can generate our schemas:

```
$ cargo run schema
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s
     Running `target/debug/schema schema`
Removing "/home/hashed/confio/git/book/examples/03-basics/schema/contract.json" â€¦
Exported the full API as /home/hashed/confio/git/book/examples/03-basics/schema/contract.json
```

I encourage you to go to generated file to see what the schema looks like.


The problem is that, unfortunately, creating this binary makes our project fail
to compile on the Wasm target - which is, in the end, the most important one.
Hopefully, we don't need to build the schema binary for the Wasm target - let's
align the `.cargo/config` file:

```toml
[alias]
wasm = "build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --lib"
wasm-debug = "build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --lib"
schema = "run schema"
```

The `--lib` flag added to `wasm` cargo aliases tells the toolchain to build
only the library target - it would skip building any binaries. Additionally, I
added the convenience `schema` alias so that one can generate schema calling
simply `cargo schema`.

## Disabling entry points for libraries

Since we added the "rlib" target for the contract, it is, as mentioned before, useable as a dependency.
The problem is that the contract depended on ours would have Wasm entry points generated twice - once
in the dependency and once in the final contract. We can work this around by disabling generating Wasm
entry points for the contract if the crate is used as a dependency. We would use
[feature flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html) for that.

Start with updating `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[features]
library = []
```

This way, we created a new feature for our crate. Now we want to disable the `entry_point` attribute on
entry points - we will do it by a slight update of `src/lib.rs`:

```rust,noplayground
# use cosmwasm_std::{entry_point, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};
# use error::ContractError;
# use msg::{ExecuteMsg, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
# 
# pub mod contract;
# pub mod error;
# pub mod msg;
# pub mod state;
# 
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    contract::instantiate(deps, env, info, msg)
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    contract::execute(deps, env, info, msg)
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    contract::query(deps, env, msg)
}
```

The [`cfg_attr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#the-cfg_attr-attribute) attribute is
a conditional compilation attribute, similar to the `cfg` we used before for the test. It expands to the given attribute if
the condition expands to true. In our case - it would expand to nothing if the feature "library" is enabled, or it
would expand just to `#[entry_point]` in another case.

Since now to add this contract as a dependency, don't forget to enable the feature like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
my_contract = { version = "0.1", features = ["library"] }
```
