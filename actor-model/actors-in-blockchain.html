                        <h1 id="actors-in-blockchain"><a class="header" href="#actors-in-blockchain">Actors in blockchain</a></h1>
<p>Previously we were talking about actors mostly in the abstraction of any
blockchain-specific terms. However, before we would dive into the code, we need
to establish some common language, and to do so we would look at contracts from
the perspective of external users, instead of their implementation.</p>
<p>In this part, I would use the <code>wasmd</code> binary to communicate with the malaga
testnet. To properly set it up, check the <a href="../wasmd-quick-start.html">Quick start with
<code>wasmd</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain-as-a-database"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-as-a-database">Blockchain as a database</a></h2>
<p>It is kind of starting from the end, but I would start with the state part of
the actor model. Relating to traditional systems, there is one particular thing
I like to compare blockchain with - it is a database.</p>
<p>Going back to the previous section we learned that the most important part of
a contract is its state. Manipulating the state is the only way to persistently
manifest work performed to the world. But What is the thing which purpose is to
keep the state? It is a database!</p>
<p>So here is my (as a contract developer) point of view on contracts: it is a distributed
database, with some magical mechanisms to make it democratic. Those &quot;magical
mechanisms&quot; are crucial for BC's existence and they make they are reasons why even
use blockchain, but they are not relevant from the contract creator's point of
view - for us, everything that matters is the state.</p>
<p>But you can say: what about the financial part?! Isn't blockchain (<code>wasmd</code> in particular)
the currency implementation? With all of those gas costs, sending funds seems
very much like a money transfer, not database updates. And yes, you are kind of right,
but I have a solution for that too. Just imagine, that for every native token (by
&quot;native tokens&quot; we meant tokens handled directly by blockchain, in contradiction
to for example cw20 tokens) there is a special database bucket (or table if you prefer)
with mapping of address to how much of a token the address possesses. You can query
this table (querying for token balance), but you cannot modify it directly. To modify
it you just send a message to a special build-in bank contract. And everything
is still a database.</p>
<p>But if blockchain is a database, then where are smart contracts stored?
Obviously - in the database itself! So now imagine another special table - this
one would contain a single table of code-ids mapped to blobs of wasm binaries. And
again - to operate on this table, you use &quot;special contract&quot; which is not accessible
from another contract, but you can use it via <code>wasmd</code> binary.</p>
<p>Now there is a question - why do I even care about BC being a DB? So the reason
is that it makes reasoning about everything in blockchain very natural. Do you
remember that every message in the actor model is transactional? It perfectly
matches traditional database transactions (meaning: every message starts a new
transaction)! Also, when we later talk about migrations, it would turn out, that
migrations in CosmWasm are very much equivalents of schema migrations in
traditional databases.</p>
<p>So, the thing to remember - blockchain is very similar to a database, having some
specially reserved tables (like native tokens, code repository), with a special
bucket created for every contract. A contract can look at every table in every
bucket in the whole blockchain, but it can modify the only one he created.</p>
<h2 id="compile-the-contract"><a class="header" href="#compile-the-contract">Compile the contract</a></h2>
<p>I will not go into the code for now, but to start with something we need compiled
contract binary. The <code>cw4-group</code> contract from
<a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus">cw-plus</a> is simple enough to work with, for
now, so we will start with compiling it. Start with cloning the repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git clone git@github.com:CosmWasm/cw-plus.git
</code></pre>
<p>Then go to <code>cw4-group</code> contract and build it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cd cw-plus/contracts/cw4-group
$ docker run --rm -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;:/code \
  --mount type=volume,source=&quot;$(basename &quot;$(pwd)&quot;)_cache&quot;,target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.6
</code></pre>
<p>Your final binary should be located in the
<code>cw-plus/artifacts</code> folder (<code>cw-plus</code> being where you cloned your repository).</p>
<h2 id="contract-code"><a class="header" href="#contract-code">Contract code</a></h2>
<p>When the contract binary is built, the first interaction with CosmWasm is uploading
it to the blockchain (assuming you have your wasm binary in the working directory):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd tx wasm store ./cw4-group.wasm --from wallet $TXFLAG -y -b block
</code></pre>
<p>As a result of such an operation you would get json output like this:</p>
<pre><code>..
logs:
..
- events:
  ..
  - attributes:
    - key: code_id
      value: &quot;1069&quot;
    type: store_code
</code></pre>
<p>I ignored most of not fields as they are not relevant for now - what we care
about is the event emitted by blockchain with information about <code>code_id</code> of
stored contract - in my case the contract code was stored in blockchain under
the id of <code>1069</code>. I can now look at the code by querying for it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd query wasm code 1069 code.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>And now the important thing - the contract code is not an actor. So, what is a
contract code? I think that the easiest way to think about that is a <code>class</code> or
a <code>type</code> in programming. It defines some stuff about what can be done, but the
class itself is in most cases not very useful unless we create an instance
of a type, on which we can call class methods. So now let's move forward to
instances of such contract classes.</p>
<h2 id="contract-instance"><a class="header" href="#contract-instance">Contract instance</a></h2>
<p>Now we have a contract code, but what we want is an actual contract itself.
To create it, we need to instantiate it. Relating to analogy to programming,
instantiation is calling a constructor. To do that, I would send an
instantiate message to my contract:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd tx wasm instantiate 1069 '{&quot;members&quot;: []}' --from wallet --label &quot;Group 1&quot; --no-admin $TXFLAG -y
</code></pre>
<p>What I do here is create a new contract and immediately call the <code>Instantiate</code>
message on it. The structure of such a message is different for every contract
code. In particular, the <code>cw4-group</code> Instantiate message contains two fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>members</code> field which is the list of initial group members optional <code>admin</code></li>
<li>field which defines an address of who can add or remove
a group member</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, I created an empty group with no admin - so which could never
change! It may seem like a not very useful contract, but it serves us as a
contract example.</p>
<p>As the result of instantiating, I got the result:</p>
<pre><code>..
logs:
..
- events:
  ..
  - attributes:
    - key: _contract_address
      value: wasm1u0grxl65reu6spujnf20ngcpz3jvjfsp5rs7lkavud3rhppnyhmqqnkcx6
    - key: code_id
      value: &quot;1069&quot;
    type: instantiate
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we again look at <code>logs[].events[]</code> field, looking for
interesting event and extracting information from it - it is the common case.
I will talk about events and their attributes in the future but in general,
it is a way to notify the world that something happened. Do you remember the
KFC example? If a waiter is serving our dish, he would put a tray on the bar,
and she would yell (or put on the screen) the order number - this would be
announcing an event, so you know some summary of operation, so you can go and
do something useful with it.</p>
<p>So, what use can we do with the contract? We obviously can call it! But first
I want to tell you about addresses.</p>
<h2 id="addresses-in-cosmwasm"><a class="header" href="#addresses-in-cosmwasm">Addresses in CosmWasm</a></h2>
<p>Address in CosmWasm is a way to refer to entities in the blockchain. There are
two types of addresses: contract addresses, and non-contracts. The difference
is that you can send messages to contract addresses, as there is some smart
contract code associated with them, and non-contracts are just users of the
system. In an actor model, contract addresses represent actors, and
non-contracts represent clients of the system.</p>
<p>When operating with blockchain using <code>wasmd</code>, you also have an address - you
got one when you added the key to <code>wasmd</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># add wallets for testing
$ wasmd keys add wallet3
- name: wallet3
  type: local
  address: wasm1dk6sq0786m6ayg9kd0ylgugykxe0n6h0ts7d8t
  pubkey: '{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey&quot;,&quot;key&quot;:&quot;Ap5zuScYVRr5Clz7QLzu0CJNTg07+7GdAAh3uwgdig2X&quot;}'
  mnemonic: &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can always check your address:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd keys show wallet
- name: wallet
  type: local
  address: wasm1um59mldkdj8ayl5gknp9pnrdlw33v40sh5l4nx
  pubkey: '{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey&quot;,&quot;key&quot;:&quot;A5bBdhYS/4qouAfLUH9h9+ndRJKvK0co31w4lS4p5cTE&quot;}'
  mnemonic: &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Having an address is very important because it is a requirement for being able
to call anything. When we send a message to a contract it always knows the
address which sends this message so it can identify it - not to mention that
this sender is an address that would play a gas cost.</p>
<h2 id="querying-the-contract"><a class="header" href="#querying-the-contract">Querying the contract</a></h2>
<p>So, we have our contract, let's try to do something with it - query would be the
easiest thing to do. Let's do it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd query wasm contract-state smart wasm1u0grxl65reu6spujnf20ngcpz3jvjfsp5rs7lkavud3rhppnyhmqqnkcx6 '{ &quot;list_members&quot;: {} }'
data:
  members: []
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>wasm...</code> string is the contract address, and you have to substitute it with
your contract address. <code>{ &quot;list_members&quot;: {} }</code> is query message we send to
contract. Typically, CW smart contract queries are in the form of a single JSON
object, with one field: the query name (<code>list_members</code> in our case). The value
of this field is another object, being query parameters - if there are any.
<code>list_members</code> query handles two parameters: <code>limit</code>, and <code>start_after</code>, which
are both optional and which support result pagination. However, in our case of
an empty group they don't matter.</p>
<p>The query result we got is in human-readable text form (if we want to get the
JSON from - for example, to process it further with <code>jq</code>, just pass the
<code>-o json</code> flag). As you can see response contains one field: <code>members</code> which is
an empty array.</p>
<p>So, can we do anything more with this contract? Not much. But let's try to do
something with a new one!</p>
<h2 id="executions-to-perform-some-actions"><a class="header" href="#executions-to-perform-some-actions">Executions to perform some actions</a></h2>
<p>The problem with our previous contract is that for the <code>cw4-group</code> contract,
the only one who can perform executions on it is an admin, but our contract
doesn't have one. This is not true for every smart contract, but it is the
nature of this one.</p>
<p>So, let's make a new group contract, but this time we would
make ourselves an admin. First, check our wallet address:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd keys show wallet
</code></pre>
<p>And instantiate a new group contract - this time with proper admin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd tx wasm instantiate 1069 '{&quot;members&quot;: [], &quot;admin&quot;: &quot;wasm1um59mldkdj8ayl5gknp9pnrdlw33v40sh5l4nx&quot;}' --from wallet --label &quot;Group 1&quot; --no-admin $TXFLAG -y
..
logs:
- events:
  ..
  - attributes:
    - key: _contract_address
      value: wasm1n5x8hmstlzdzy5jxd70273tuptr4zsclrwx0nsqv7qns5gm4vraqeam24u
    - key: code_id
      value: &quot;1069&quot;
    type: instantiate
</code></pre>
<p>You may ask, why do we pass some kind of <code>--no-admin</code> flag, if we just said, we
want to set an admin to the contract? The answer is sad and confusing, but...
it is a different admin. The admin we want to set is one checked by the
contract itself and managed by him. The admin which is declined with
<code>--no-admin</code> flag, is a wasmd-level admin, which can migrate the contract. You
don't need to worry about the second one at least until you learn about
contract migrations - until then you can always pass the <code>--no-admin</code> flag to
the contract.</p>
<p>Now let's query our new contract for the member's list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd query wasm contract-state smart wasm1n5x8hmstlzdzy5jxd70273tuptr4zsclrwx0nsqv7qns5gm4vraqeam24u '{ &quot;list_members&quot;: {} }'
data:
  members: []
</code></pre>
<p>Just like before - no members initially. Now check an admin:</p>
<pre><code>$ wasmd query wasm contract-state smart wasm1n5x8hmstlzdzy5jxd70273tuptr4zsclrwx0nsqv7qns5gm4vraqeam24u '{ &quot;admin&quot;: {} }'
data:
  admin: wasm1um59mldkdj8ayl5gknp9pnrdlw33v40sh5l4nx
</code></pre>
<p>So, there is an admin, it seems like the one we wanted to have there. So now we
would add someone to the group - maybe ourselves?</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wasmd tx wasm execute wasm1n5x8hmstlzdzy5jxd70273tuptr4zsclrwx0nsqv7qns5gm4vraqeam24u '{ &quot;update_members&quot;: { &quot;add&quot;: [{ &quot;addr&quot;: &quot;wasm1um59mldkdj8ayl5gkn
p9pnrdlw33v40sh5l4nx&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;: 1 }], &quot;remove&quot;: [] } }' --from wallet $TXFLAG -y
</code></pre>
<p>The message for modifying the members is <code>update_members</code> and it has two
fields: members to remove, and members to add. Members to remove are
just addresses. Members to add have a bit more complex structure: they
are records with two fields: address and weight. Weight is not relevant
for us now, it is just metadata stored with every group member - for
us, it would always be 1.</p>
<p>Let's query the contract again to check if our message changed anything:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wasmd query wasm contract-state smart wasm1n5x8hmstlzdzy5jxd70273tuptr4zsclrwx0nsqv7qns5gm4vraqeam24u '{ &quot;list_members&quot;: {} }'
data:
  members:
  - addr: wasm1um59mldkdj8ayl5gknp9pnrdlw33v40sh5l4nx
    weight: 1
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the contract updated its state. This is basically how
it works - sending messages to contracts causes them to update the state,
and the state can be queried at any time. For now, to keep things simple
we were just interacting with the contract directly by <code>wasmd</code>, but as described
before - contracts can communicate with each other. However, to investigate
this we need to understand how to write contracts. Next time we will look
at the contract structure and we will map it part by part to what we have learned
until now.</p>
